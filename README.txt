To run: 
Part 1: "python3 main.py" and select option "A"
         or
        "python3 buildDB.py"
        
Part 2: "python3 main.py" and select option "B" to run queries

NOTES: 

 Part 1
 - Was done through python, the code makes the calls to the OS referencing the original text files. These text files must be placed into      the "RawData" folder! 

 - Folders organize the steps taken in sorting, formatting and building the indexs from the text files.
